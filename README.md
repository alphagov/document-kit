# Document Kit

Document Kit is a set of components which teams can use to build interactive
HTML documents.

It's currently an alpha, built with the GDS Enabling Strategy discovery teams
in mind.

## Example

Take a look at the `examples/` directory for a working example.

## Building from source

Document Kit uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile SASS and minify
JavaScript. It outputs the built files (and any images) into the `dist/`
directory.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```
